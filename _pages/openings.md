# Postdoc

We don't have opening now. 

# Graduate Students

Year 2024-2025: Dr. Zhou has one opening.  

Highly motivated graduate students in the departments of biological sciences, statistics, and PULSe program at Purdue are encouraged to contact us for rotation. For students coming from biology background, available projects include genetic risk prediction based on whole genome sequencing data, gene by environment analysis in All of Us, integrating GWAS with microbiome, and investigating the success rate of experimental validation for GWAS identified targets. For students coming from statistics or computer science background, available projects include method development for genetic risk prediction and fine mapping in admixed population, and AI/LLM in biobank. Programming skills are preferred but not required for biology students, but you must be willing to learn it in the first year and comfortable with ChatGPT assisted trouble shooting. For students in statistics, prior knowledge of biology is not required. Feel free to contact us if you have interest.

# Undergraduate and Master Students

If you are interested in computational biology, you are always welcome to our group. Dr. Zhou has mentored 8 undergraduate and master students in the past 3 years, 4 of them are currently enrolled or admitted to the graduate program (4 PhD of statistics/computational biology and 1 master of data science) in US. Feel free to contact us if you want to know what research looks like.
