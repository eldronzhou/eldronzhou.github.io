Graduate Students

Year 2024-2025: Dr. Zhou has one opening.  

Highly motivated graduate students in the departments of biological sciences, statistics, and PULSe program at Purdue are encouraged to contact us. For students coming from biology background, available projects include genetic risk prediction based on whole genome sequencing data, gene by environment analysis in All of Us, integrating GWAS with microbiome, and investigating the success rate of experimental validation for GWAS identified targets. For students coming from statistics or computer science background, available projects include method development for genetic risk prediction and fine mapping in admixed population, and AI/LLM in biobank. Programming skills are preferred but not required for biology students, but you must be willing to learn it in the first year and comfortable with trouble shooting. For students in statistics, prior knowledge of biology is not required. Feel free to contact us if you have interest.

Undergraduate and Master Students

If you are interested in computational biology, you are always welcome to our group. Dr. Zhou has mentored over 5 undergraduate and master students in the past 3 years, many of them are now enrolled in the PhD program (mostly statistics) in US. Feel free to contact us.
